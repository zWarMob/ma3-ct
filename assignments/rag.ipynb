    "## RAG System Optimization Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "To enhance the performance of our Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline—particularly by reducing hallucinations—we made targeted adjustments to the prompt, chunking strategy, retrieval settings, and language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Adjustments\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prompt Refinement**  \n",
    "   The prompt was updated to instruct the model to only use retrieved context and respond with *\"I don't know\"* when necessary, reducing hallucinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Improved Chunking**  \n",
    "   Switched to a **recursive character-based splitter** with:\n",
    "   - `chunk_size = 500`\n",
    "   - `chunk_overlap = 75`  \n",
    "   This better preserves context and minimizes fragmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Increased `k` from 3 to 4**  \n",
    "   Retrieving more chunks per query improved coverage for split or scattered information.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Greater Overlap**  \n",
    "   Boosting overlap from 50 to 75 tokens ensured smoother context transitions across chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `ibm/granite-3-8b-instruct`\n",
    "`{'retrieval_quality': 0.92, 'answer_correctness': 0.92, 'hallucination': 0.08}`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Balanced performance** with high correctness and minimal hallucination.\n",
    "- Effectively grounded and accurate without being overly conservative.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `mistralai/mistral-large`\n",
    "`{'retrieval_quality': 0.94, 'answer_correctness': 0.84, 'hallucination': 0.0}`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Zero hallucinations**, making it ideal for high-accuracy contexts.\n",
    "- Slightly lower correctness due to conservative outputs and under-answers.\n",
    "- Maintains strong retrieval quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "`mistralai/mistral-large` offers excellent reliability without any hallucinations but may under-deliver in general-purpose scenarios due to its caution. In contrast, `ibm/granite-3-8b-instruct` strikes a better balance between **correctness** and **groundedness**, making it the more effective model for this task."
